No async reset
CONFIG_SYN_NO_ASYNC
  Say Y here if you disable asynchronous reset in some of the IP cores.
  Might be necessary if the target library does not have cells with
  asynchronous set/reset.

Scan support
CONFIG_SYN_SCAN
  Say Y here to enable scan support in some cores. This will enable
  the scan support generics where available and add logic to make
  the design testable using full-scan.
