2013.3:
 * Version 7.0 (Rev. 2)

 * Cosmetic GUI changes to table header row, no change in functionality
 * Added additional support for future devices
 * Behavioral VHDL model replaced by Encrypted RTL
 * Internal standardization in source file delivery, does not change behavior

 * Optimized support for UltraScale devices
 * Removed C model dependency on stlport (STL Portability) library; C model now uses STL built into the compiler
 * Windows C model DLLs are statically linked to the Windows C run-time (CRT) library, to remove the runtime dependency on MSVCRT90.dll, which can cause problems when using the C model in a Windows compiler other than Visual Studio 2008
 * C model updated to use third-party library MPIR version 2.6.0 (previously was version 2.2.1); the Windows MPIR DLLs are also statically linked to the Windows CRT library, to remove the dependency on MSVCRT90.dll
 * C model updated to use third-party library MPFR version 3.1.2 (previously was version 3.0.1); the Windows MPFR DLLs are also statically linked to the Windows CRT library, to remove the dependency on MSVCRT90.dll
